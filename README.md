## Installation Instructions

For those crazy among that actually want to install this extension (most people just laugh at the screenshot and the fact we built it in the first place).
I won't be held responsible for any points you lose by getting the wrong answer. You have been warned.

1. Download better-trailhead.zip, and unzip it somewhere.
2. Bring up the Extensions management page by going to this URL: chrome://extensions
2. Ensure that the "Developer mode" checkbox in the top right-hand corner is checked.
3. Click "Load unpacked extension".
4. Go to where you unzipped the extension and open that path.
